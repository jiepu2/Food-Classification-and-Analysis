# Melbourne Food Analytics on the Cloud

In this project, we examined the dietary intake habits in the Inner Melbourne region using crawled Instagram photos. We used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize the types of food photos, and achieved an accuracy of up to 82% for 101 selected types of food dataset. We applied the food recognition module to analyze the crawled Instagram photos, and established the dietary intake profile for the Inner Melbourne areas. To improve the efficiency and stability of this algorithm, we deployed the systems for our harvester and food recognition on NeCTAR cloud. Hypotheses were tested concerning the correlation between dietary intake habits and other socio-economic and health profiles.

The Python files for analysis are stored in Crawler-Analysis folder. A shapefile featuring dietary intake profiles and socio-economic profiles are stored in the Shapefile folder. And the statistical data are stored in the Statistics folder.
